# Stupid/Funny Love Calculator ðŸ’˜

This is a stupid love calculator based on the old days of Facebook where you type in your crush's name and your name and it would give you a random love compatibility answer. 
I wrote this program in Python and gave it a random algorithm to "calculate" the love between the first name and the last name......purely, based on Name ðŸ˜…

Instructions:

1. Mention your name at the prompt

2. mention your crush's name at the prompt

3. You will get a love score

Algorithm:

The algorithm is very simple and hard coded. 

1. It looks for the amount of times the letters in either name spells the word TRUE and the letters in each name spells LOVE

2. Add the amount of times together for TRUE to make a whole number. Do the same thing with the amount of times for LOVE.

3. Combine the two digits together to make a 2 digit number. TRUE first, LOVE second.

4. That is your love score

Example:

Name 1 = Ramtin
Name 2 = Maya

In both name 1 and name 2
- T occurs 1 time
- R occurs 1 time
- U occurs 0 times
- E occurs 0 times
- Total = 2

- L occurs 0 times
- O occurs 0 times
- V occurs 0 times
- E occurs 0 times
- Total = 0
- Love Score = 20

See? True love is THAT easy ðŸ˜€
